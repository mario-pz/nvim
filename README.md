# I use NeoVim BTW

## Instructions

Clone the repo to .config directory in your HOME destination.

## Demo using docker

```
docker run -it mario-pz/nvim:latest # or add a specific tag
```

The image is a bit chonky because it needs a variety of components that are essential to install the plugins


## Note

My config is small and elitist. Meaning if you expect a full blown slow IDE inside the terminal, this config/editor might not be for you.
